	// You will ask the user to guess this random number. 
	// If the user guesses the wrong number,
	//		You should print out, "Your answer was too big/too small! Try again!"
	// When they get the correct answer,
	// Print out "You guessed correctly! It only took you (the number of tries it took them) tries!"


	// How to generate a random number:
	// rand() is a function that generates a random integer from 0 to RANDMAX
	// 		RANDMAX is a variable defined in <stdlib.h> (from line 1). 
	//		RANDMAX is computer dependent but is guaranteed to be at least 32767.

	// If I want to get a random number n in the range x <= n < y
	//		int n = (rand() % (y-x)) + x

	// GOOD LUCK!
